# 🚀 Optimizing Delivery Logistics with MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4j  

## 📝 Description  
This project explores the use of **MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4j** to optimize real-time delivery coordination between **BART transit and delivery drones**. By leveraging flexible database systems, real-time caching, and graph-based route optimization, we aim to enhance efficiency, reduce delivery time, and improve customer experience.  

## 💡 Business Cases  
### 📦 **Business Case #1: Optimized Delivery with MongoDB & Redis**  
- **MongoDB** enables **real-time updates** and **geo-spatial queries** for efficient route planning.  
- **Redis** improves data retrieval speed, real-time notifications, and caching of frequently accessed data.  
- **Impact**: Reduced reliance on human delivery drivers, lower delivery time, and environmentally friendly logistics.  

### 🔗 **Business Case #2: Dynamic Route Optimization with Neo4j**  
- **Graph-based algorithms** improve delivery scheduling and adaptability to urban transit.  
- **Algorithms Used**:  
  - **Yen’s Algorithm**: Identifies multiple shortest paths for alternate routes.  
  - **Betweenness Centrality**: Pinpoints key transit hubs for enhanced traffic flow management.  
  - **Louvain Algorithm**: Detects community-based delivery zones for efficiency.  
- **Impact**: Faster and more adaptive delivery routes, improved transit hub responsiveness, and better customer satisfaction.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **MongoDB** – Flexible NoSQL database for **real-time data updates** and **geo-spatial queries**  
- **Redis** – High-performance **in-memory database** for caching and real-time notifications  
- **Neo4j** – Graph database for **dynamic route optimization** and **traffic-aware scheduling**
